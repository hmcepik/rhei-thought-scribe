## üéØ Project Overview

RHEI Voice Notes is an AI-powered productivity tool that eliminates transcription bottlenecks by enabling employees to capture, transcribe, and organize spoken ideas instantly. Built as part of RHEI's Made for Teams initiative, it transforms voice recordings into searchable, organized notes with automatic AI-powered summaries.

**Problem Solved:** Employees waste time manually transcribing communications, rely on external tools that break workflows, or skip documentation entirely - creating knowledge silos and operational inefficiencies.

**Solution:** A workflow multiplier that captures ideas at the speed of thought and channels them into existing communication patterns.

### One-Click Demo
üîó **Live Demo:** [https://rhei-thought-to-scribe.lovable.app/](https://rhei-thought-to-scribe.lovable.app/)

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18.3.1 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **Build Tool:** Vite for lightning-fast development
- **Speech Recognition:** Web Speech Recognition API (browser-native)
- **Storage:** localStorage (privacy-first approach)
- **Deployment:** Lovable + Supabase platform
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui for consistent design

**Stack Rationale:** This combination provides optimal balance of development speed, runtime reliability, and future scalability while eliminating procurement friction for immediate validation.

## üèó Architecture Decisions

### MVP Strategy: Browser-Native First
- **Web Speech Recognition API** for zero-latency, cost-free transcription
- **Immediate user feedback** essential for adoption
- **Zero procurement friction** enables instant testing

### V2 Migration Path
- **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text:** Enterprise reliability, real-time streaming
- **OpenAI Whisper:** 4x cost reduction, superior accuracy
- **Strategic validation:** Test user needs first, optimize economics second

### Data Architecture
- **Privacy-first localStorage** eliminates breach risks
- **Zero external dependencies** for sensitive voice data
- **Complete user control** over personal note history

## üé® User Experience

### Core Workflow
1. **Record** ‚Üí Click large circular button, speak naturally
2. **Transcribe** ‚Üí Real-time text appears as you speak
3. **Edit** ‚Üí Refine transcription and add context
4. **Save** ‚Üí Auto-generated title with timestamp
5. **Organize** ‚Üí Search, filter, and manage note history

### Mobile-Optimized
- Touch-friendly interface for meeting contexts
- Offline capability for unreliable WiFi
- Background recording while switching apps

## üìä Success Metrics

- **Transcription Accuracy:** >90% for clear speech
- **Processing Speed:** Sub-second response times
- **User Experience:** Intuitive interface requiring no training
- **Adoption Goal:** Zero learning curve with immediate productivity gains

## üîß Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Support Level | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Chrome | ‚úÖ Full | Recommended for best experience |
| Edge | ‚úÖ Full | Complete Web Speech API support |
| Safari | ‚úÖ Full | iOS and macOS compatible |
| Firefox | ‚ùå Limited | Web Speech API constraints |

## üöß Known Limitations & Roadmap

### Current Constraints
- Browser dependency for Web Speech API
- Performance varies with microphone quality
- localStorage limit (~5-10MB)
- Single-user focus (no team collaboration)

### V2 Roadmap for Made for Teams
- **Enhanced AI:** Google Cloud Speech-to-Text + OpenAI Whisper migration
- **Team Features:** Shared note libraries, collaborative editing
- **Integrations:** Direct Slack posting, email sharing, calendar integration
- **Advanced Capabilities:** Multi-speaker identification, meeting transcription
- **Mobile:** PWA installation, offline sync, push notifications
- **Templates:** Meeting notes, voice memos, project updates

## üîê Privacy & Security

- **Fully client-side operation** - no server-side data storage
- **Permission-based access** - explicit microphone permission required
- **Local data control** - users own their transcription history
- **No tracking** - zero analytics or external scripts

## üéØ Product Strategy for RHEI Integration

### Daily Workflow Integration
- Seamless capture during meetings and brainstorming
- Immediate editing and refinement capabilities
- Search across historical context for decision-making
- Copy/paste integration with existing tools

### Adoption Features
- Auto-generated titles with timestamps
- Familiar UI patterns minimizing learning curves
- Real-time feedback building user confidence
- Confirmation dialogs preventing accidental data loss

### Risk Management
- Browser-native implementation eliminates vendor lock-in
